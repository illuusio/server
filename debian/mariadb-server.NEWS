mariadb (1:10.11.2-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  MariaDB 10.11.2 was released on February 16th 2023 by the MariaDB Foundation
  (https://mariadb.org/mariadb-10-11-2-ga-now-available/). This is the first
  release in the 10.11 series to be announced GA (general availability). The
  10.11 series has long-term support with commitment from the MariaDB Foundation
  (https://mariadb.org/about/#maintenance-policy) to publish maintenance
  versions with fixes to software defects and security vulnerabilities until
  February 2028.

  The previous major releases (10.7, 10.8, 10.9, 10.10) were not long-terms
  supported versions and thus not imported to Debian. To learn what is new in
  10.11 it is recommended to read all the release notes:

  * https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-1011/
  * https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-1010/
  * https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-109/
  * https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-108/
  * https://mariadb.com/kb/en/changes-improvements-in-mariadb-107/

  Noteable new features:
  - New datatypes UUID and INET4
  - New functions SFORMAT (text formatting), NATURAL_SORT_KEY, RANDOM_BYTES and
    several related to JSON
  - New keyword AUTO in system versioned tables for partitioning
    (https://mariadb.com/kb/en/system-versioned-tables/#automatically-creating-partitions)
  - Unicode Collation Algorithm (UCA) upgrade to 14.0.0
  - New privileges 'READ ONLY ADMIN' and 'GRANT TO PUBLIC'
    (https://mariadb.org/grant-to-public-in-mariadb/)
  - password_reuse_check plugin (part of mariadb-server package)
  - Hashicorp Key Management Plugin for implementing encryption using keys
    stored in the Hashicorp Vault KMS (mariadb-plugin-hashicorp-key-management
    package)

  Important packaging change: Compression libraries have been split into
  separate packages named mariadb-provider-plugin-(bzip2/lz4/lzma/lzo/snappy).
  If a non-zlib compression algorithm was used in InnoDB or Mroonga before
  upgrading to 10.11, those tables will be unreadable until the appropriate
  compression library is installed.

  Things to consider when upgrading from 10.6 to 10.11 are listed on the page
  https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading-from-mariadb-10-6-to-mariadb-10-11/.

  New server variables in 10.11 (compared to 10.6):
  - binlog-alter-two-phase: When set, split ALTER at binary logging into 2
    statements: START ALTER and COMMIT/ROLLBACK ALTER. Defaults to 'FALSE'.
  - innodb-log-file-buffering: Whether the file system cache for ib_logfile0 is
    enabled
  - optimizer-extra-pruning-depth: If the optimizer needs to enumerate join
    prefix of this size or larger, then it will try aggressively prune away the
    search space.
  - log-slow-min-examined-row-limit: Don't write queries to slow log that
    examine fewer rows than that
  - log-slow-query: Log slow queries to a table or log file. Defaults logging to
    a file 'hostname'-slow.log or a table mysql.slow_log if --log-output=TABLE
    is used. Must be enabled to activate other slow log options.
  - log-slow-query-file: Log slow queries to given log file. Defaults logging to
    'hostname'-slow.log. Must be enabled to activate other slow log options
  - log-slow-query-time: Log all queries that have taken more than
    log_slow_query_time seconds to execute to the slow query log file. The
    argument will be treated as a decimal value with microsecond precision
  - slave-max-statement-time: A query that has taken more than
    slave_max_statement_time seconds to run on the slave will be aborted. The
    argument will be treated as a decimal value with microsecond precision. A
    value of 0 (default) means no timeout
  - system-versioning-insert-history: Allows direct inserts into ROW_START and
    ROW_END columns if secure_timestamp allows changing @@timestamp
  - wsrep-allowlist: Allowed IP addresses split by comma delimiter
  - wsrep-status-file: wsrep status output filename

  Changed behavior in server variables in 10.11 (compared to 10.6):
  - explicit-defaults-for-timestamp: enabled by default
  - optimizer-prune-level: defaults to 2 (instead of 1)
  - old-mode: new options IGNORE_INDEX_ONLY_FOR_JOIN and COMPAT_5_1_CHECKSUM
  - wsrep-mode: new option BF_ABORT_MARIABACKUP
  - read-only: changing value requires 'READ ONLY ADMIN' privilege

  One of the most important performance related server variables
  'innodb_log_file_size' is now dynamic so it can be changed without having to
  restart the server.

  Removed in 10.11 (compared to 10.6):
  - innodb-log-write-ahead-size: the physical block size of the underlying
    storage is instead detected and used
  - wsrep-replicate-myisam: use wsrep_mode instead
  - wsrep-strict-ddl: use wsrep_mode instead

  Deprecated server variables:
  - innodb_change_buffering
  - innodb-buffer-pool-chunk-size: defaults to 0 (instead of 134217728) in
    server variables because the server automatically sizes it
  - keep_files_on_create:	orphan files are now deleted automatically, so this
    setting should never be needed

  Note also that the MariaDB client settings have changed to now use SSL/TLS
  by default.

mariadb (1:10.11.1-1) unstable; urgency=medium

  Version suffixed packages (e.g. mariadb-server-10.6) have now been deprecated
  as it made maintenance complicated and there was no known use cases or users
  of the naming scheme, as multiple different major version MariaDB server
  packages could not be co-installed anyway and source or the 'mariadb-server'
  and 'mariadb-client' packages is easiest controlled by repositories and
  package versioning, not versions in package *names*.

mariadb-10.5 (1:10.5.5-1) unstable; urgency=medium

   The latest version 10.5 of the MariaDB Server came out in June 2020 and is
   guaranteed to have security releases at least until summer 2025.

   For more information on what is new in MariaDB 10.5 check out:
   https://speakerdeck.com/ottok/debconf-2020-whats-new-in-mariadb-server-10-dot-5-and-galera-4
   or video from https://peertube.debian.social/videos/watch/bb80cf53-d9ba-4ed9-b472-a21238fb67f5.

   Quick summary:
   - Service name is now 'mariadb', e.g. /etc/init.d/mariadb and systemctl mariadb
   - The main server binary is now running as 'mariadbd' instead of old 'mysqld'
   - Many commands are now mariadb-* instead of old mysql*, but old names
     continue to work as symlinks
   - Referencing the /etc/mysql/debian.cnf file is not advised anymore. It will
     be deprecated in a future Debian release and has been obsolete anyway for
     several years now since MariaDB in Debian introduced Unix socket
     authentication for the root account in 2015.

   MariaDB 10.5 has been tested to be backwards compatible with all previous
   versions of MariaDB and all previous versions of MySQL up until version 5.7.
   Note that MySQL 8.0 introduces significant backwards incompatible changes
   compared to MySQL 5.7, and thus in-place binary upgrades from MySQL 8.0 to
   MariaDB 10.5 are not possible, but sysadmins need to upgrade by exporting and
   importing SQL dumps of their databases.

   If you encounter any bugs, please make sure your bug report is of highest
   standards so we can quickly reproduce and fix the issue. Even better if you
   find the solution yourself, and can submit it as a Merge Request at
   https://salsa.debian.org/mariadb-team/mariadb-10.5/

   If you appreciate the Debian packaging work done, please star us on Salsa!

mariadb-10.1 (10.1.20-1) unstable; urgency=low

    MariaDB is now the default MySQL variant in Debian, at version 10.1. The
    Stretch release introduces a new mechanism for switching the default
    variant, using metapackages created from the 'mysql-defaults' source
    package. For example, installing the metapackage 'default-mysql-server' will
    install 'mariadb-server-10.1'. Users who had 'mysql-server-5.5' or
    'mysql-server-5.6' will have it removed and replaced by the MariaDB
    equivalent. Similarly, installing 'default-mysql-client' will install
    'mariadb-client-10.1'.

    Note that the database binary data file formats are not backwards
    compatible, so once you have upgraded to MariaDB 10.1 you will not be able
    to switch back to any previous version of MariaDB or MySQL unless you have a
    proper database dump. Therefore, before upgrading, please make backups of
    all important databases with an appropriate tool such as 'mysqldump'.

    The 'virtual-mysql-*' and 'default-mysql-*' packages will continue to exist.
    MySQL continues to be maintained in Debian, in the unstable release. See the
    page https://wiki.debian.org/Teams/MySQL more information about the
    mysql-related software available in Debian.
