# String "-10.6." needs to be in path as MariaDB releases several series in
# parallel (e.g 10.6, 10.4, 10.3 etc) and uscan should check for updates only
# in the 10.6-series.

# Automated signature checking with pgpsigurlmangle has been available
# only since devscripts version 2.13.3

# Specifically use ftp.nluug.nl because is supports https and the main page has a file listing
# suitable for scanning new releases, while other servers either lack https or have the main
# directory masked by a half-empty index.html file.
