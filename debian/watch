# String "-10.11." needs to be in path as MariaDB releases several series in
# parallel (e.g 10.11, 10.4, 10.3 etc) and uscan should check for updates only
# in the 10.11-series.

# Automated signature checking with pgpsigurlmangle has been available
# only since devscripts version 2.13.3

# Specifically use archive.mariadb.org because it supports https and the main
# page has a file listing suitable for scanning new releases.
# The archive.mariadb.org service is under MariaDB Foundation control and is
# the official source for new releases.
